Caesar cipher is one of the earliest and simplest method of encryption technique.
In this we use a secret key that the sender shares with receiver.
We simply shift every letter of the message by the key.
example:
message=hello and key=2,so 'h' gets shift to the right by 2 i.e 'h' becomes 'j','e' becomes 'g' an so on
on encryption 'hello' is converted into 'jgnnq'
In decryption we simply shift every letter to the left by key i.e in this case 2.
